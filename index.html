      narrative:`You meet Marisol just before first period. Her backpack sits in her lap and she twists the strap as she talks. She explains that the panic usually starts when the bus fills at one particular stop. Her chest tightens, hands go cold, and she worries she will faint in front of everyone. She has started skipping that stop when it looks crowded which makes her late.

At home she works evening shifts at a grocery store to help with bills, then watches siblings and finishes homework. Sleep is short. She liked the calm she felt at a lunch mindfulness club last year but stopped when her schedule changed. She asks for skills she can try right away and says she would rather practice something concrete than talk about feelings for a long time.

She wants to graduate on time and not be the student who leaves class after ten minutes. She prefers a woman clinician who understands the pressure she feels as the oldest in a Latinx family. She is unsure about breathing exercises that feel awkward, but is open to trying things that are quick and practical.` },

      narrative:`You meet Devon after orientation. He sits back with arms crossed at first, then leans forward when talking about beats he makes on his phone. He describes what happened at the warehouse: a supervisor called him out for break time in front of everyone; he raised his voice; security arrived; he walked out. He is not proud of it, but he also does not want to be humiliated.

He says he will show up if the program is real. He would rather practice how to handle a tense moment at work than sit through another lecture about attitude. He wants help finding a job that is not a trap, with someone to check in on site the first weeks.

Transportation is thin to the industrial parks, and he tries not to walk after dark due to police stops. He asks what you tell probation and what you keep private.` },
