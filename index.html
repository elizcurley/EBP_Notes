const CASES = [
  { /* Marcos */ title:"Marcos: Missed Shifts, Rising Panic, and the Weight of Being the Provider",
    client_profile:"Name: Marcos (he or him)\nAge: 28\nIdentities: Mexican American Latine man\nLanguage: English preferred, fluent Spanish\nFamily: Lives with partner and two children, ages 3 and 7\nEmployment: Line cook at a busy restaurant",
    setting:"Community mental health walk-in clinic. Appointments are 30 minutes and follow up scheduling is inconsistent due to long waitlists. Sessions occur in a shared office with minimal sound privacy. The referring provider asked for support after Marcos reported panic-like episodes and trouble working full shifts.",
    presenting_problem:"Over the past month Marcos has had intense episodes of shortness of breath, dizziness, and sweating. These occur at least twice per week, sometimes more. He has left three work shifts early and missed two entirely. His supervisor has warned him that his hours will be reduced if this continues. He is sleeping about four hours per night and reports frequent irritability at home.",
    relevant_history:"He had similar but milder episodes a few years ago under significant stress. No prior therapy. No substance use. He recently took on extra shifts after his partner’s hours were cut. He reports tension with his partner about finances and parenting roles. He describes long standing pressure to appear calm and capable in front of family. A medical exam two weeks ago found no cardiac concerns. He remains worried something might be physically wrong.",
    goals_and_preferences:"He wants the episodes to stop, wants to keep his job, and wants to be more patient with his children. He feels ashamed about missing work and does not want extended therapy commitments. He prefers strategies he can use privately, but he is unsure what that would look like.",
    strengths_and_resources:"Strong work ethic, reliable employee until recently, close relationship with his children and brother, strong cultural values around providing for family, good problem solving skills in fast paced environments.",
    contextual_factors_and_barriers:"His schedule changes weekly and sometimes daily. The family has limited childcare and struggles to cover rent. He worries about being judged by family if he shares what is happening. The apartment is small with little space for privacy. His restaurant does not offer paid sick leave. Attendance at outside appointments is challenging because of transportation and work demands.",
    ebp_decision_point:"What brief, private, feasible supports can reduce panic-like episodes and help shift completion given work and family constraints.",
    target_outcomes:"Reduced frequency and intensity of episodes; improved shift completion; improved patience at home and sleep.",
    risks_and_ethics:"Physical symptoms need monitoring because he fears something medical is being overlooked. Work pressure may influence disclosure. If family tension is explored, it must be done in a way that respects cultural values around responsibility and privacy.",
    equity_signal:"Managing distress within unstable hourly labor conditions, economic precarity, restricted access to flexible care, and cultural norms discouraging emotional disclosure.",
    narrative:`Marcos sits forward in the chair, elbows on his knees, rubbing his palms together as he talks. He says he feels embarrassed even being here, but he also feels scared. He describes the first recent episode happening during a crowded dinner rush. The kitchen had been short staffed and he had been working for nearly eight hours without a break. Suddenly his chest tightened and his vision blurred. He grabbed the counter to steady himself and thought he might pass out. He told his supervisor he needed air and went outside, where he sat on a crate until the dizziness passed.

Since then the episodes have struck in other places, including at home when helping his daughter with math homework. He reports feeling “on edge all day” because he never knows when the next one will happen. He presses a hand to his forehead and says he hates that his children have started watching him closely, as if they sense something is wrong.

He worries constantly about money. With his partner’s reduced hours, he has been picking up as many shifts as possible. Missing work feels like a failure, but he also feels terrified of having an episode in front of customers. He has begun having trouble focusing at home. His partner has told him he seems distracted and distant. He says he does not know how to explain what is happening without sounding dramatic.

He avoids discussing these episodes with his parents because he does not want them to think he cannot handle stress. He was raised with the idea that personal problems should be handled privately. He laughs weakly and says that in his family everyone is supposed to be tough.

He mentions he barely sleeps. He lies awake doing mental math about rent and groceries. When he does fall asleep, he wakes up sweating. He had a medical evaluation recently that found no cardiac issues, but the reassurance has not fully settled him. He is unsure whether the problem is emotional, physical, or something else entirely.

Near the end of the session he looks up and asks if people ever get completely better from something like this. The question hangs in the air, full of hope and fear. He says he wants to feel like himself again, but he does not know where to begin.

Referral Note from Primary Care Provider:
Client reports three episodes of chest tightness in the past two weeks. ECG normal. Provider suspects anxiety related symptoms. Recommended behavioral health consult due to work impairment.`
  },
  { /* Shawn */ title:"Shawn: Headaches, Exhaustion, and Everyone Counting on Him",
    client_profile:"Age 32. He and him. Black. Works full-time in a warehouse distribution center. Primary caregiver for his mother who has mobility limitations. Lives with his mother and younger sister. Limited health insurance coverage.",
    setting:"Emergency Department social work consult in a busy urban hospital. Brief, private space but significant time pressure. Social worker has 15 minutes before Shawn is discharged.",
    presenting_problem:"Shawn arrived with severe headaches, dizziness, and a feeling that he might pass out. He has visited the Emergency Department three times in the last two months with similar symptoms. Medical tests are normal, and clinicians suspect stress-related contributors but have not ruled out other causes. Shawn appears embarrassed, saying he “must be wasting everyone’s time.”",
    relevant_history:"Shawn works early morning shifts with heavy lifting. He often skips breaks to leave on time to take care of his mother’s needs. He has not seen a primary care provider in over a year because scheduling conflicts make it difficult. He reports worsening sleep, increased irritability, and sometimes feeling “on edge” without knowing why. He denies any diagnosis of anxiety or depression. He frequently feels responsible for keeping his family stable after his father’s death.",
    goals_and_preferences:"Shawn wants the headaches and dizziness to stop. He wants to “get back to normal” and keep his job performance strong. He prefers not to take medications without clear need. He also says he “doesn’t have time” for therapy appointments but is open to learning strategies he can do between shifts. He wants to avoid anything that would require rearranging caregiving responsibilities.",
    strengths_and_resources:"Reliable worker. Deeply committed to family. Strong problem-solving skills. Has one close friend at work he trusts. Engaged in his church community when able.",
    contextual_factors_and_barriers:"Erratic work schedule, transportation challenges, limited access to primary care, caregiver responsibilities, financial strain, internalized expectations to be “strong.”",
    ebp_decision_point:"Brief coping supports vs. stronger linkages to outpatient care vs. workplace-related contributors to address now.",
    target_outcomes:"Reduced headache frequency or severity; improved functioning; consistent follow-up with appropriate supports.",
    risks_and_ethics:"Avoid minimizing symptoms with a potential medical basis; avoid implying blame; attend to racialized labor expectations.",
    equity_signal:"Racialized labor expectations, limited flexible healthcare, and caregiving responsibilities shape options and stress exposure.",
    narrative:`Shawn sits on the edge of the Emergency Department stretcher, shoulders rounded, his work uniform still covered in dust. The bright lights make him wince. He keeps apologizing for “being back again,” as though he owes the staff an explanation for his pain. When he shifts, he massages the back of his neck, wincing like the movement itself reminds him of something he’s been trying to ignore.

He describes waking that morning with a pounding headache that spread behind his eyes. At work, he started feeling lightheaded. He thought the sensation would pass, but it grew worse when he reached for a heavy box. His supervisor insisted he go to the Emergency Department “just to be safe.” Instead of relief, Shawn says he feels like a burden.

When you ask about stress, he shrugs. “I mean, everyone’s stressed. That’s life.” Slowly, details surface: the early shifts with mandatory overtime, the small kitchen paycheck that keeps the household just stable, his mother’s increased mobility challenges, and his fear that if he slows down, everything will fall apart. He laughs softly when you ask about rest. “Rest is for people with backup plans.”

Shawn admits he has been snapping at his sister more often, which makes him feel guilty. Sleep is inconsistent. He often lies awake, thinking through bills or replaying moments when he could have “done better.” The more you gently explore, the more he admits the symptoms have been building for months.

Still, he insists he cannot change his routine. Appointments feel impossible. Asking for help feels disrespectful to everything his parents sacrificed. He says he doesn’t want medication unless absolutely necessary but is open to “tools or tips” that won’t require more time off or additional costs.

As the discharge process begins, Shawn watches the clock anxiously. He needs to get home to help his mother with lunch and prepare for his next shift. He looks exhausted but determined, like someone who cannot imagine putting his own needs first without something else falling apart.

  { /* Iliana */ title:"Iliana: A Mother in a New Country Trying Not to Fall Apart",
    client_profile:"Age 27. She and her. Recently immigrated from Guatemala. Speaks Spanish; understands some English but prefers Spanish. Lives with her two young children in a family shelter.",
    setting:"Family shelter social work intake room. Limited privacy; frequent interruptions. Shelter requires brief, goal-oriented assessments due to high demand.",
    presenting_problem:"Iliana reports persistent feelings of overwhelm, difficulty sleeping, and episodes of sudden crying. She worries she is “not being a good mother” because the children “see her sad.” Staff observed her appearing distressed during nightly check-in and suggested meeting with the social worker.",
    relevant_history:"Iliana left Guatemala after escalating threats from a former partner. She traveled with her children through multiple regions before arriving in the United States. Since arrival, she has focused on survival: securing shelter, food, and school enrollment for her children. She has no local family. She has applied for asylum but has not yet received updates.",
    goals_and_preferences:"She wants to be calm enough to care for her children, sleep better, and stop crying suddenly. Talking helps but she becomes nervous when asked about past experiences. She prefers methods that do not require leaving the shelter until she feels more settled. She does not want to take pills that will make her tired.",
    strengths_and_resources:"Loving parent. Deep cultural and spiritual resilience. Strong connection to her children. Participates in informal mutual aid networks among other Spanish-speaking mothers.",
    contextual_factors_and_barriers:"Uncertain immigration status, limited English, lack of transportation, shared living space, limited childcare, minimal phone data, high emotional load, and ongoing fear that her former partner may find her.",
    ebp_decision_point:"Stabilize distress via brief grounding, community support connections, or structured referrals given barriers and preferences.",
    target_outcomes:"Improved emotional regulation; reduced distress episodes; improved sleep or functioning during caregiving routines.",
    risks_and_ethics:"Trauma risk; avoid coercive disclosure; ensure safety without retraumatization; cultural humility with spiritual coping.",
    equity_signal:"Migration trauma, gender-based violence, language access barriers, and structural vulnerability shape options.",
    narrative:`The intake room is cramped, and the hum of shelter activity seeps through the thin door. Iliana sits with her hands folded tightly, as if holding herself together. She smiles politely at first, but as she begins describing her last few weeks, tears gather at the edges of her eyes. She apologizes repeatedly for crying, explaining that she “never used to be like this.”

She describes waking in the middle of the night with her heart pounding. She tries to be quiet so she does not wake the children sleeping beside her. During the day, she becomes overwhelmed by simple tasks: filling out paperwork, remembering appointments, managing the shelter schedule. She sometimes feels her vision narrow when both children need her attention at the same time. She says the sadness comes “like a wave,” fast and unpredictable.

She is careful about the details she shares. When you ask gently about her journey to the United States, she hesitates, saying the memories are difficult. She shifts to talking about her children instead. They love school, she says. They are learning English quickly. She wants to be strong for them. She smiles again, briefly, before her face collapses into worry.

Iliana says she is afraid to leave the shelter alone. She worries her former partner may somehow find them. She has avoided taking buses because she does not understand the routes. She has one friend in the shelter she trusts, another mother who shares snacks and watches her children during showers. Sometimes Iliana joins the mothers in the hallway for quiet evening conversations, which she says helps.

When asked what she hopes will change, she sighs: she wants to feel calm enough to sleep and patient enough to support her children without feeling like she is failing. She does not want medication unless there is no other way. She says talking helps but she does not want to talk about “the dangerous things” yet. Her hands tremble slightly as she rubs her palms together.

There is a sense that she is holding a very heavy story, but she is not ready to open it. She wants help, but on her terms, slowly, gently.

    setting:"Community mental health drop-in center. Brief counseling session with 20 minutes available. Semi-private room with occasional hallway noise and interruptions.",
    presenting_problem:"Reports “meltdowns” linked to missed deadlines and overwhelm. Contractor work unstable due to late submissions or forgotten steps. Hyperfocus periods followed by crashes where tasks feel impossible. Shame and fear of disappointing clients.",
    relevant_history:"Strong creative academics; struggled with organization/time management. Always needed reminders and structure. Recently moved and lost social routine. Planning apps overwhelm via notifications. Inconsistent therapy due to fluctuating income.",
    goals_and_preferences:"Manage work tasks without spiraling; stop freezing near deadlines. Supports that fit creative workflow, not rigid systems. Dislikes feeling monitored. Open to emotion-regulation and task initiation strategies.",
    strengths_and_resources:"Strong creative skills. Supportive roommates. Good insight. Online creative communities. Curious and reflective.",
    contextual_factors_and_barriers:"Irregular income, unpredictable hours, self-employed pressure, fear of losing clients, crowded living environment, sensory overload, inconsistent sleep.",
    ebp_decision_point:"Grounding and emotion regulation vs structured supports adapted to preferences and flexible work life.",
    target_outcomes:"Improved task follow-through; reduced distress during deadlines; improved daily functioning.",
    risks_and_ethics:"Avoid pathologizing neurodivergence; ensure autonomy; avoid overwhelming with rigidity.",
    equity_signal:"Labor instability, self-employed precarity, neurodivergent needs, and gender identity misunderstandings intersect.",
    narrative:`Morgan sits curled forward, both hands wrapped around a large insulated cup they forgot to fill before the appointment. Their eyes flick from the window to the notebooks scattered across the table, as though each one holds a reminder of something undone. They apologize three times before you can tell them they have nothing to apologize for.

They describe a pattern they cannot break. They accept a design assignment, feel excited, and spend hours sketching. But when it is time to finalize the piece or send drafts, their body seems to shut down. “It’s like my brain hits a wall,” they say. They stare at the screen, unable to begin. Their chest tightens, their thoughts race, and suddenly they are cleaning the kitchen or scrolling for hours. By the time they return to the project, they are embarrassed, behind, or both.

They explain that these shutdowns make them feel like a fraud. Their clients think they are talented, but Morgan fears they will eventually realize “how broken” they are. When you ask what they do during overwhelm, Morgan says they try breathing exercises they saw online, but sometimes the exercises make them feel more aware of how “bad at life skills” they are.

Morgan moved to the city hoping for independence. They love their roommates but feel guilty when they overhear them reminding Morgan of overdue tasks. At times, they avoid opening emails entirely. “If I don’t look, I can pretend I’m not disappointing anyone,” they say, picking at the sleeve of their sweater.

When asked about supports that have worked in the past, Morgan brightens slightly. They loved a structured mentorship in college but felt overwhelmed by the weekly assignments. They enjoy working in cafés but find them overstimulating. They are open to strategies that start small and respect their creative process.

As the meeting ends, Morgan says quietly, “I just want to feel like I can trust myself again.” There is exhaustion in their voice, but also a spark of hope that things might feel more manageable with the right approach.

    narrative:`Sofia sits at the small round table with her knees pulled to her chest, her hoodie drawn up around her face. The fluorescent overhead lights flicker slightly. She glances up each time they buzz, then looks back down. Her mother sighs softly, rubbing her temples in exhaustion.

Sofia explains that mornings have become unbearable. She wakes up already tense, anticipating the hallway noise. She describes the cafeteria as “a hundred radios playing different static.” Even in class, she finds herself bracing for the bell. When she cannot predict sounds or movements, her heartbeat speeds up, and her hands shake. Some days she makes it to the car before crying; other days she refuses to put on her shoes.

Her mother speaks with equal parts frustration and worry. She is afraid that missed days will affect Sofia’s progress. She also fears losing her job when she is late because of morning meltdowns. She feels caught between advocating for her daughter and wanting the school to understand the situation more fully.

Sofia avoids discussing peers. When asked about this year’s changes, she shrugs and looks away. She says she does not want to “make a big deal” but does not feel comfortable in some spaces anymore. She has one teacher she trusts, who lets her work quietly in a corner when the room gets too loud.

As you explore her hopes, Sofia quietly says she wants to come to school, but she wants it to feel “less like drowning.” She is unsure what would help but says she likes drawing because it feels grounding. She is open to trying small things but fears they will not make a difference.

    narrative:`Mateo arrives wearing his restaurant uniform, smelling faintly of citrus cleaner and fryer oil. He apologizes for the wait even though he is early. His leg bounces as he sits, and he keeps adjusting his baseball cap as though he is trying to settle into his own body.

He explains that last night he drank more than planned after a chaotic dinner rush. A coworker bought a round “to celebrate surviving Friday,” and he felt awkward refusing. Once he started drinking, he found himself staying longer than intended. He woke up groggy, ashamed, and terrified he might be “heading down the same road” as his father. He emphasizes that he does not drink every day, but the pattern feels familiar and frightening.

When you ask what he wants, he says he wants to feel “in control again.” He likes his job and the social nature of the work. He does not want to be the person who says no to everything. At the same time, he hates waking up worried he messed up again. He describes a tug-of-war inside himself: the part that enjoys relaxing with coworkers and the part that feels sick afterward. He worries he is disappointing himself and the people he loves.

He mentions two cousins he lives with who “party sometimes” but do not pressure him. He has thought about attending more online meetings but feels embarrassed turning his camera on and anxious about being seen in person. He does not want to quit drinking entirely, at least not right now, but he does want to stop crossing the line he keeps crossing.

During quieter moments, he admits he feels lonely after work and finds it easier to join his coworkers than go home to an empty apartment. He wonders if he drinks partly to delay sitting with certain emotions. His eyes well when he says this, but he quickly looks away.

Mateo says he needs tools that work when he is exhausted, overstimulated, and surrounded by coworkers who see drinking as bonding. He does not know what those tools might be, but he knows he cannot keep doing things the same way.

    narrative:`Linh sits upright in the small clinic office chair, smoothing Bao’s jacket on her lap even though he is not present. Her expression is a mix of worry and exhaustion. She explains that she received a note from the school yesterday describing Bao as “disruptive” and “unusually emotional.” She did not sleep well because she kept rereading the phrasing, wondering if the teachers blame her.

She describes Bao as bright and enthusiastic. At home he loves showing her drawings, asking endless questions, and helping in the kitchen. But lately homework has turned into a fight almost every evening. He rushes through math problems, makes mistakes, then becomes upset when she asks him to slow down. Sometimes he cries and says his brain “feels too busy.” Linh feels pulled between comforting him and insisting he finish his work.

She explains that she works long evening shifts at a restaurant, often coming home tired and stressed. She tries to create structure for Bao but feels her energy is limited. In her own childhood, children were expected to sit calmly and complete tasks without negotiation. She feels confused when traditional methods do not seem to work for Bao. “I tell him to focus, but he cannot,” she says, her voice breaking slightly. “I do not understand what he needs from me.”

As she talks, her fears come to light. She is worried the school is labeling him too quickly. She is worried teachers will think her parenting is inadequate. She is worried that if she pushes too hard, she will harm his confidence, but if she does not push enough, he will fall behind. She wonders whether other children struggle like this or whether something is wrong.

When asked what she hopes will change, Linh says she wants home to feel peaceful again. She wants Bao to succeed without feeling overwhelmed. She wants to understand how to support him in ways that match her values, her schedule, and his needs. She knows she cannot change the pressures of work or school, but she hopes there are tools that can make their evenings less painful.

    narrative:`Farah sits quietly, hands folded neatly over her purse. She has dark circles beneath her eyes. When she speaks, her voice is soft, as if she is choosing every word carefully. She says she has not slept more than two hours a night for weeks. She lies awake long after everyone has gone to bed, waiting for her body to settle, but instead she feels waves of tightness rolling through her stomach.

She explains that since her father’s death, she has been holding the family together. Her mother relies on her for translation, paperwork, and emotional encouragement. Her siblings gravitate toward her room at night, seeking comfort. She says she feels honored to care for her family but also overwhelmed. She has not cried in front of them, because she fears it will make them feel even worse.

Farah says she cannot rest because the house is full, and privacy is limited. She describes lying awake listening to relatives snore, cough, whisper in other rooms. When she finally begins to drift, she is startled awake by anxious thoughts that she cannot quite explain. She says it feels like her body is “running a race without permission.”

At work, she keeps her head down and focuses on repetitive tasks. Coworkers ask how she is doing, and she answers politely, but she feels “hollow.” When you ask what she needs most, she hesitates, then says she wants the nights to feel less frightening. She wants her mind to slow down enough to breathe. She is open to ideas but not ready for anything that feels too emotionally demanding.

    narrative:`Riley sits cross-legged in the counseling chair, sleeves pulled over their hands. Their voice is quiet but steady. They explain that when conflict happens at home, something inside “switches off.” They describe feeling heat rise in their face, then a cold sensation spreading through their arms, followed by silence. They say they can hear people talking, but it feels like they cannot move.

Last night’s shutdown began after a small argument about homework. Their mother raised her voice slightly, and Riley felt a surge of panic. They describe it as “everything getting too loud, too close.” They retreated to their room, stared at the wall, and lost track of time. When their mother checked in hours later, Riley could not find words to explain what happened.

They say their mother is trying, but the household feels complicated. Their stepfather does not address their gender at all. Riley says silence from him feels “heavier than yelling.” They feel safest online, where friends use their correct name and affirm their identity. At school, they keep their head down but enjoy art class.

When asked what they want to be different, Riley thinks for a long time. They say they want a way to stay present during tense moments without going numb. They want to feel like they have tools before shutting down completely. They are open to ideas but want them to feel private, manageable, and not overly emotional.

    narrative:`Mr. Thompson settles slowly into the exam chair, gripping the armrest for balance. He jokes that the clinic chairs “were not made for old knees,” but the humor lands softly, almost like a memory of how he used to sound. He explains that the pain has been worse since winter started. On cold mornings, he wakes feeling stiff and exhausted before the day even begins.

He says he spends most days in his recliner because moving around the apartment takes effort. He tries to distract himself with movies, but he often loses focus. Meals have become simpler too, usually canned soup or toast because standing in the kitchen hurts. When you ask about friends or social routines, he shrugs. Most people live across town, and the bus stop is too far to walk reliably. He says it feels embarrassing to cancel plans when his body “refuses to cooperate.”

When asked about mood, he describes days that blur together. “I keep thinking about my wife,” he says quietly. “The house is too quiet without her.” He says he talks to her sometimes, just to hear his own voice. He adds that the loneliness sneaks up on him, especially at night. His daughter calls when she can, but he hates worrying her.

He wants to feel useful again, even in small ways. He misses tinkering with tools or chatting with neighbors. He says he is not sure what would help but knows he cannot continue like this. He does not want to feel numb or dependent but is open to trying “something that gives me a little push forward.”

When you greet him, he gives a polite nod but keeps his eyes lowered. He explains that since coming home, everything feels “too big.” The grocery store aisles, the early-morning buses, even the sky. He says he spent two years indoors with controlled routines, and now the world feels unpredictable.

He describes waking at 4 a.m. from dreams he cannot fully remember. His chest feels tight, and his heart pounds. At work, he tries to follow instructions carefully, but when tasks shift suddenly or someone raises their voice, he freezes. He fears looking incompetent. He worries that if he loses the job, he will violate supervision requirements.

At home, the tension is different. He is grateful to live with his sister, but her expectations feel strict. She wants him to relax, but noise from her children overwhelms him. When she asks him questions too quickly, he feels cornered. Last week, after a misunderstanding about chores, he shut down completely and spent hours sitting on the floor of his room, breathing through panic he did not know how to stop.

He says he keeps thinking about mistakes, even small ones, and imagining terrible consequences. He tries to shake the thoughts off but cannot. He wants tools that do not draw attention, especially at work. He also wants to avoid anything that would lead to disclosures he fears might be misinterpreted by his supervision officer.

He leans forward near the end of the session and says quietly, “I want to do this right. I want a life that feels like mine again.”
